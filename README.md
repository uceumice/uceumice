# [Welcome Traveler](https://www.ueuie.dev/?from=github)

Hey, my name is Alex. I am a software developer enthusiast. When I'm off work, I like to write blog on topics related to bleeding edge tech and staff related to my field of expertise, be it authentication, web development or dev-ops. See my blog at dev.uceumice.com. If you are here just for the purpose of getting your job done, then check out the catalog of repos which contain a more hands-on approach to the related topic.
